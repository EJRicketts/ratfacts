  "Rats have a split upper lip (you can see the cleft under their nose), which allows them to use their incisors more effectively—each half of the lip can move aside as the incisors gnaw. This is a characteristic feature of rodents (the word \"rodent\" comes from Latin for \"to gnaw\").",
  "In some ecosystems, rats have caused massive ecological damage. For instance, rats introduced to Easter Island are suspected to have wiped out the island’s palm trees by eating all the seeds, contributing to deforestation centuries ago.",
  "In genetic studies, mutant strains of lab rats have been created to model human diseases. For instance, there are lab rats bred to develop high blood pressure (hypertension) so scientists can study cardiovascular disease and test medicines.",
  "Selective breeding of fancy rats has produced not only various colors but also different ear placements and even tailless rats. \"Dumbo rats\" have ears set lower on the head and larger, giving them a cute, elephantine look, and \"Manx rats\" are bred without tails.",
  "Rats sometimes exhibit \"deferred violence\": a rat might tolerate another rat’s presence when food is abundant, but once the food is gone, aggression might suddenly occur to drive the intruder away.",
  "Rats cannot sweat like humans do. Instead, they regulate their body temperature by dilating or constricting blood vessels in their tail and ears to dissipate heat, and by panting when extremely hot. A rat’s tail acts like a radiator to release excess body heat.",
  "The maturity of rats can be gauged by the color of their incisors: adult rats have yellow-orange teeth (from iron deposits in the enamel), whereas young rats’ teeth start out white and gradually turn yellow as they harden.",
  "Rats can learn to recognize complex shapes and even differentiate between human faces. Studies using photos have shown that rats can pick out a familiar face versus a stranger’s face, indicating good visual memory despite their relatively poor eyesight acuity.",
  "Osgood’s Vietnamese rat (Rattus osgoodi) is one of the smallest rat species, with a body only about 12–17 cm long (5–7 inches). In contrast, some of the largest true rats, like the Bosavi woolly rat, can be over 80 cm (32 inches) in total length including the tail.",
  "The English word \"rat\" comes from Middle English (and before that from Old English \"rætte\"), which likely came from a Proto-Germanic word *rattaz. It’s thought to be imitative of the scratching or gnawing sounds rats make.",
  "The earliest known record of a rat-catching dog was named \"Hatch\". His remains were recovered from the Mary Rose, the flagship of King Henry VIII. This suggests that even in the 1500s, ships utilized rat-catching dogs on board.",
  "In ancient Rome, there was no separate word for rat; they used \"mus maximus\" (big mouse) and \"mus minimus\" (little mouse). This shows how closely rats and mice were linked in people’s minds historically.",
  "Wild rats can carry several ectoparasites: tropical rat mites, lice, and fleas among them. Sometimes when an infested rat nest is destroyed, those parasites disperse in the area. This is why after poisoning or trapping rats, thorough cleaning (and sometimes insecticide use) is recommended to avoid a secondary pest issue like a flea outbreak.",
  "Chicago has ranked as the number one \"rattiest\" city in the U.S. for several years (based on pest control data), followed by cities like Los Angeles and New York.",
  "Rats have very few sweat glands (mostly on the bottoms of their feet). Instead of sweating, when they overheat they will spread saliva on their fur and then cool off by evaporation—similar to how some mammals lick themselves to cool down.",
  "Even among rats, there are introverts and extroverts. Lab tests have identified some rats that are \"shy\" (reluctant to explore new spaces) and others that are \"bold\" (quick to investigate). These personality traits can affect how well a rat does in problem-solving tasks and how it interacts socially.",
  "All pet laboratory rats today are thought to descend from rats caught by rat-catchers in the 1800s. The albino \"Wistar rat\" was one of the first standardized lab rat strains (developed around 1906).",
  "In 2022, New York City announced the creation of a \"Rat Czar\" – an official position to coordinate citywide rat control efforts. This came after years of complaints and some viral videos of rats (like the famous \"Pizza Rat\") highlighting the issue.",
  "Studies of rat behavior have contributed to understanding addiction. In one famous study, rats in a stimulating \"Rat Park\" with social companions were far less interested in morphine-laced water than rats isolated in barren cages. This suggests that environment and social factors play a big role in the tendency to seek drugs.",
  "Rats have a vibrissal sense that rivals vision in importance to them. They will whisk their whiskers against surfaces to create a sort of tactile map of their surroundings. If a rat’s whiskers are ever trimmed (as in some experiments), the rat becomes much less sure-footed and slow until they grow back.",
  "In some sewers, workers have reported that rats will actually attack snakes (like pythons) if cornered. A swarm of rats can bite a snake repeatedly, sometimes killing it. This shows that while snakes prey on rats, large rat colonies can occasionally fend off a snake through sheer numbers and aggression.",
  "Rats tend to follow the same paths (called runways) between their nest and food sources. Over time, these paths become obvious: you might see greasy rub marks along walls or beaten-down trails in grass where rats habitually travel. They are creatures of habit and prefer using familiar safe routes.",
  "The old Jameson Whiskey distillery in Dublin included a milk budget for the distillery cats that were kept to control rats in the grain stores. Many breweries and distilleries historically kept cats for this purpose, and some still have \"working cats\" today.",
  "Although rats are often associated with filth, they actually spend a lot of time grooming. A healthy rat grooms itself and its cage-mates multiple times a day, keeping their fur clean and in good condition (they can be as fastidious as cats).",
  "Rats are very curious but also cautious. A wild rat encountering a new object (like a trap) might avoid it for days (this is called \"new object neophobia\"). Only after the object has been in the environment for some time will the rat feel safe enough to approach or investigate it.",
  "Urban rats often have small territories. Studies in New York have shown that many sewer rats live and die within the same 150-foot radius, rarely venturing further because all their needs are met locally (food from trash, shelter underground).",
  "Not all animals called \"rats\" are true rats. The term is used for many medium-sized rodents. For instance, kangaroo rats (North America) or pack rats (woodrats) aren’t in the genus Rattus at all. \"True rats\" refers mainly to Rattus species like the brown and black rat.",
  "There is a legend that in some big cities, rats in different neighborhoods have evolved into distinct \"tribes\" or breeds. Genetic studies in New York City actually showed that uptown and downtown rat populations do have subtle genetic differences due to staying in their own areas (separated by the busy midtown area).",
  "Rats demonstrate a phenomenon called \"social buffering\": being housed with other rats can reduce an individual’s stress levels (measured by stress hormones), showing the importance of social companionship for their well-being.",
  "It is possible for a rat to swim up through a building’s plumbing and emerge in a toilet bowl. This rare occurrence happens in some city buildings when sewer rats navigate the maze of pipes in search of food.",
  "The Canadian province of Alberta (population 4.25 million) is the largest inhabited area known to be completely free of rats. Since the 1950s, Alberta has maintained an aggressive rat control program (especially along its border) to prevent any rats from establishing breeding populations in the province.",
  "In 2019, Los Angeles experienced an outbreak of typhus (a flea-borne illness) in downtown areas with high rodent activity. This reminded urban authorities that diseases like typhus and plague, though rare in modern times, can still re-emerge in unsanitary, rat-infested conditions.",
  "Female rats are in heat (estrus) roughly every 4–5 days, and this receptive period lasts about 12 hours. If multiple males are around, a female may mate with several; consequently, a single litter of pups can have multiple fathers.",
  "London’s Victorian-era sewer system helped conquer cholera but created a perfect environment for rats. To this day, an estimated two million rats inhabit London’s underground sewer networks, feeding on food scraps that wash down drains.",
  "Brown rats have acute hearing, are sensitive to ultrasound, and possess a very highly developed sense of smell. On the other hand, their vision is poor (approximately 20/600 acuity), and they are mostly colorblind.",
  "In folklore, rats are sometimes depicted as weather prophets. In some seafaring legends, if rats were seen abandoning a ship en masse, it was taken as a sign the ship would sink (hence the saying \"like rats fleeing a sinking ship\").",
  "The earliest known record of the Pied Piper story comes from the town of Hamelin itself. A stained glass window in a church (dated around 1300) depicted the piper leading children (and possibly rats) away. The church was destroyed in the 17th century, but the legend lives on as a cautionary tale, likely inspired by real rat infestations and perhaps historical events.",
  "Foods that are toxic to most animals can sometimes be eaten by rats with less effect. For example, rats have a high tolerance for naphthalene (mothballs) and somewhat for strychnine. Over time, populations of rats have even developed genetic resistance to poisons like warfarin (an anticoagulant).",
  "The tooth enamel of rats is harder than steel (around 5.5 on the Mohs hardness scale, whereas iron is about 4.0 and human teeth about 5.0). This is due to mineral deposits in the enamel, including iron, which also gives rat incisors their orange color.",
  "Black rats have been largely driven out of inland cities in Europe and North America by the larger brown rat. Today, black rats are more common in port cities, ships, and warmer climates, while brown rats dominate sewers and subways.",
  "If food is scarce, rats may resort to cannibalism of their dead or weakest colony members. Mother rats might also eat a pup that is sick or dying. This behavior recycles nutrients to the mother and can increase the survival odds of the remaining litter in dire conditions.",
  "The phrase “lab rat” has entered common language to mean someone who is an experimental subject. This reflects how ubiquitous rats have been in research—as model organisms, they have helped test drugs, study learning, and more, often literally being the creatures running through mazes or trials.",
  "Pet rats (\"fancy rats\") have been selectively bred into many different colors and coat types (such as albino, hooded, spotted, rex fur, hairless, and even tailless varieties), all descending from the brown rat.",
  "Pacific Island cultures traveling with the Polynesian rat inadvertently changed many island ecosystems. For example, when rats reached Hawaii and other islands with no native rodents, they preyed on native bird eggs and caused extinctions of some bird species that had no defenses against mammal predators.",
  "Rats are mammals classified as \"rodents\" because they belong to the order Rodentia (characterized by ever-growing incisor teeth for gnawing).",
  "Rats are ticklish like humans. When researchers tickled young rats, the rats emitted ultrasonic \"giggles\" and would often come back for more tickling. Tickled rats also engage in \"joy jumps\" and seem to bond with the person who tickled them.",
  "Rats, like other mammals, can catch diseases from one another. They can suffer from respiratory infections (like pneumonia due to Mycoplasma bacteria) and viruses specific to rodents. Sick rats often show porphyrin (red tears) around their eyes/nose, sneezing, or ruffled fur, and they may isolate themselves from the group.",
  "The giant cloud rats of the Philippines (genus Phloeomys) are not in genus Rattus but are large, tree-dwelling rodents with bushy tails. They show how diverse the rodent family is—these cloud \"rats\" are slow, squirrel-like vegetarians, quite unlike the fast, omnivorous city rats.",
  "Female rats, when in heat, will sometimes perform a little \"dance\" called dart-hopping: they rapidly run, stop, and wiggle their ears or arch their backs to entice a male. This is part of their mating behavior to encourage the male to chase and mate.",
  "In urban legends, some tales suggest rats can grow to \"the size of dogs\" in the sewers. While this isn’t true, there are other rodents, like capybaras or nutrias, that are much larger than rats and sometimes mistaken for giant rats by the public.",
  "A rat known as \"Ratty\" was a main character in the popular children's novel, Wind in the Willows, published in 1908.",
  "Rats are often portrayed as villains in literature and film (like the army of rats in Orwell’s \"1984\" or the villainous rat in \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\"). However, literature also offers sympathetic rat characters, symbolizing their dual reputation—clever and resourceful but living in the shadows of human society.",
  "It’s estimated that in major cities like New York, rats and mice consume several tons of discarded food per day. They are essentially part of the urban waste-processing system—albeit an unsanitary and undesired part.",
  "The fleas that transmit plague prefer black rats over brown rats. Some historians suggest that as brown rats replaced black rats in Europe, plague outbreaks diminished because the new rats didn’t carry as many of the right fleas—an unintended benefit of the brown rat’s takeover.",
  "The Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans) was carried by Pacific island explorers in their canoes as a food source. The distribution and DNA of these rats have helped scientists trace ancient Polynesian migration routes, as the rat’s travels mirror human voyages between islands.",
  "Rats are known carriers of a tapeworm called Hymenolepis. Humans can contract it by ingesting food or water contaminated with rat droppings. This is one reason food storage sanitation is critical—rat feces can transmit parasites as well as diseases.",
  "The fancy rat, Rattus norvegicus domestica, is the domesticated form of the brown rat and is the most common species kept as a pet. Fancy rats are typically gentle, smart, and enjoy interacting with humans—very different from their wild street-rat cousins.",
  "Lab rats (domesticated brown rats) have helped win numerous Nobel Prizes. For example, research with rats led to the development of deep brain stimulation for Parkinson’s disease and the discovery of hormones like oxytocin’s role in social bonding.",
  "In the 1950s, scientist John B. Calhoun conducted famous overcrowding experiments with rats. Overpopulation led to social collapse and abnormal behavior in rat colonies, coining the term \"behavioral sink\" for the phenomenon.",
  "During extreme food shortages, people have resorted to eating rats. During the 1870 siege of Paris, for example, rats were caught and sold for food at high prices, as nearly all other meat had been exhausted.",
  "Rats are mostly nocturnal, doing their foraging at night. They have poor eyesight and are wary of open, bright areas, so they typically come out under the cover of darkness to search for food.",
  "In rural Asia, farmers sometimes use a method of rodent control called \"rat flooding\"—they flood burrows in rice fields to force rats out, then catch or kill them. In some places, these trapped rats are even collected as a supplemental food source.",
  "Rats memorize routes extremely well. Once a rat learns a route to a food source, it will run that route without mistakes and can remember it for a long time. If obstacles are introduced, the rat will methodically try to bypass them using its mental map of the area.",
  "A female rat can become pregnant again within 24 hours of giving birth. This postpartum estrus means that a single female could be almost continuously pregnant during her life, except while actually birthing.",
  "In some traditional Chinese medicinal texts, remedies included dried rat parts. For example, \"Wu Ling Zhi\" refers to flying squirrel feces but sometimes rat droppings were used interchangeably, believed to have healing properties. (Such practices are rare or obsolete now.)",
  "Rats are capable of recognizing individual humans. In lab settings and as pets, rats can learn to differentiate between people by smell and appearance and will show a preference for familiar people who have handled or fed them before.",
  "Brown rats likely originated on the plains of northern China. They spread across the world by traveling with humans—along the Silk Road to Europe (established there by around 1500), and then to the Americas by the mid-1700s via European ships.",
  "Male rats often emit ultrasonic \"songs\" when courting a female—similar to birdsong but beyond our hearing. These are thought to be mating calls or expressions of excitement.",
  "The average tail length of a brown rat is about 20 cm (8 inches). Tails help rats balance and communicate (they can convey mood through tail posture) and also serve as a thermoregulatory organ to shed excess body heat.",
  "Globally, rats and mice are estimated to consume or contaminate about 20% of the world’s food supply. This is why rodent control is crucial in food storage facilities—rodents not only eat food but foul it with droppings and urine, causing enormous waste.",
  "If a large fraction of a rat population is exterminated, the surviving rats often breed explosively to fill the gap. This rebound effect is one reason why sustained, consistent control measures are needed—one-off culling can lead to a quick population bounce-back as remaining rats have larger litters and more pups survive when competition is low.",
  "A group of rats living together is called a colony, but informally they’re often referred to as a \"mischief\" of rats (a fitting term given their tendency to get into things).",
  "When young rats are playing, they make plenty of ultrasonic chirps and squeaks. They especially vocalize around 50 kHz when enjoying rough-and-tumble play, which is essentially laughter that’s just out of our hearing range.",
  "Rats have a very rapid breeding cycle. The gestation period is only about 21–23 days. Pups are weaned by 4 weeks, and females can be sexually mature by around 8–10 weeks old. This means a population of rats can grow extremely quickly under ideal conditions.",
  "Rats are masters of communication. They use vocalizations (squeaks and ultrasonic sounds), scent marking (urine and gland secretions), and body language (postures and bristling fur) to convey messages to each other.",
  "The modern black rat (Rattus rattus) most likely spread across Europe during the Roman Empire’s expansion. Archaeological digs have found black rat bones in Roman settlements, indicating they hitched rides with Roman trade and military networks.",
  "The Staten Island Yankees baseball team held a naming contest in 2016, in which \"Pizza Rats\" was one of the finalists (referencing the viral \"Pizza Rat\" video). Each season they temporarily play some games as the Staten Island Pizza Rats, complete with a rat-themed logo and uniforms.",
  "The Norway rat did not actually originate in Norway. It likely came from the steppes of Central Asia (around northern China/Mongolia) and spread westward. The name \"Norway rat\" came from an 18th-century mistake by English naturalists who assumed it came on a ship from Norway.",
  "Rats have self-sharpening incisors. The front surface of each incisor has hard enamel and the back has softer dentine. When they gnaw, the back wears down faster, keeping the teeth sharp like a chisel. They also grind their teeth (brux) when relaxed, which helps keep them from overgrowing.",
  "The pack rat (also known as the woodrat, genus Neotoma) of North America is famous for hoarding shiny objects in its nest. The term \"pack rat\" in English, meaning a person who hoards, comes from this animal’s habit of collecting various odds and ends.",
  "Rats are very fast breeders. A single female can have up to 5 litters in a year, and each litter can have anywhere from 6 to 14 pups (8 on average). This high reproduction rate is why rat populations can grow so quickly if food is plentiful and there are no controls.",
  "In parts of India and Myanmar, rice farmers must plan for periodic rat population booms. For example, in northeast India, a bamboo flowering event every 48–50 years leads to massive rat breeding and subsequent crop devastation (known as \"Mautam\").",
  "Rats can learn to avoid substances that made them sick even once. This is called \"bait shyness\" or conditioned taste aversion. If a rat eats a new food and later feels ill (even hours later), it will strongly avoid that food in the future—a survival adaptation that helps them co-exist with humans’ attempts at poisoning them.",
  "Despite being colorblind and nearsighted, rats have a remarkable ability to integrate their other senses. In lab tests, blind rats (using smell, touch, and hearing) often navigate mazes almost as well as sighted rats by relying on memory and non-visual cues.",
  "In Victorian England, rat-catching was a recognized profession. The most famous rat-catcher, Jack Black (who served Queen Victoria), not only removed rats but also bred fancy-colored rats from his catches and sold them as pets, helping to start the domesticated pet rat hobby.",
  "The term \"pack rat\" for a person who hoards items comes from the packrat (Neotoma), a rodent known to collect shiny objects and household items to stash in its nest.",
  "Rats have been depicted in culture both positively and negatively: for example, the cartoon \"Ratatouille\" portrays a rat as a talented chef, whereas in the Pied Piper legend rats symbolize pestilence. This duality reflects the real-world conflict of rats as clever animals that live around us, yet often cause us harm.",
  "Rats in captivity often form \"best friend\" pairs or trios. They will snuggle, groom each other often, and become anxious if separated. This is why it’s recommended to keep pet rats in same-sex pairs or groups rather than alone; a lonely rat can become depressed or ill.",
  "Wild rats usually only live 6–12 months due to predation and harsh conditions, though in ideal conditions they can live 2–3 years. Predators, poisons, and conflicts within rat colonies all contribute to the short average lifespan of a wild rat.",
  "A Chinese folk tale describes how the rat became the first zodiac animal by riding on the ox’s back during a great race and jumping off at the last moment to win—illustrating the rat’s cunning.",
  "The Bosavi woolly rat, discovered in 2009 in Papua New Guinea, is one of the largest true rats ever found. It measured about 82 cm (32 inches) from nose to tail and weighed roughly 1.5 kg (3.3 lbs). Despite its size, it’s a gentle, slow-moving rat that lives in remote montane forests.",
  "In modern pest control, some cities use dry ice (solid CO2) in rat burrows. As it sublimates to carbon dioxide gas, it painlessly asphyxiates the rats in the burrow. This method reduces secondary poisoning risks to other animals and has been effective in parks and city gardens.",
  "Brown rats essentially replaced black rats in much of Europe by the 1800s. Today, black rats survive mostly in warmer port cities, on ships, or in rural areas with lots of trees (since they’re adept climbers), whereas brown rats thrive in subterranean urban environments like subways and sewers.",
  "To deter rats without poison, some people use strong odors that rats dislike, such as pure peppermint oil, ammonia, or predator urine. However, these are at best temporary deterrents—rats often get used to smells. The most effective prevention is denying them food and shelter.",
  "Young rats love to play-fight. Juveniles wrestle and chase each other, behavior that helps them develop social skills and hierarchy within the group.",
  "Female rats exhibit a behavior called \"lordosis\" when receptive to mating: they arch their backs and move their tails to the side to facilitate copulation.",
  "Rats were central to a classic psychology experiment by B.F. Skinner. In a \"Skinner box,\" rats learned to press levers to receive food rewards, helping to demonstrate principles of operant conditioning (learning through rewards and punishments). This research on rats was foundational for behavioral psychology.",
  "In the wild, rats usually live in colonies of a few to a dozen individuals that share a burrow system. Big \"rat swarms\" as seen in movies are exaggerated; if many rats are seen together above ground, it’s typically because a food source is attracting rats from several nearby burrows, not one giant unified swarm.",
  "Rats have an excellent sense of taste and will often nibble a tiny bit of a new food to test it. They can detect if something is off (like bitterness from some poisons) and will reject foods that made them or other rats sick in the past.",
  "In scientific research, rats have contributed to many breakthroughs. For example, rats were crucial in the discovery of insulin (through experiments causing diabetes in rats), and they have been models for studying cancer, transplants, and behavioral psychology.",
  "Although they are extremely adaptable to surviving in cities, rats do have natural predators even in urban environments. Cats, dogs, birds of prey (like hawks and owls), and snakes all prey on rats when given the chance, helping keep rat numbers in check.",
  "Rats excrete a pigment in their tears called porphyrin. If a rat is stressed or ill, it may produce excess porphyrin around the eyes and nose (sometimes called \"red tears\"). Seeing this red crust (often around the eyes or nostrils) is a sign that the rat is unwell or under stress.",
  "Despite their reputation for being dirty, rats groom each other and themselves frequently. Rats will nibble and lick each other’s fur (especially around the head and neck) in social grooming sessions that reinforce bonds and help keep the group clean.",
  "Rats can perceive ultraviolet light, which is invisible to humans. This ability might help them follow urine trails (which reflect UV light) or see markings that humans can’t. It’s one of the ways their sensory world differs from ours.",
  "Rats are known carriers of over 60 pathogens that can affect humans, including Salmonella (food poisoning), Leptospira (cause of leptospirosis), Yersinia pestis (plague), hantaviruses, and Lassa fever virus, among others.",
  "Male rats have a bone in their penis called a baculum. This bone allows for prolonged mating. In evolutionary terms, this helps a male rat increase the chance of fertilizing a female, especially in an environment where she might mate with multiple males.",
  "During the Black Death, plague doctors wore masks with beaks not only to filter air but perhaps also because they believed the plague was spread by \"bad air.\" They didn’t know rats and fleas were a major factor—an early example of how the connection between rats and disease was not understood until much later.",
  "A rat can fall as far as 15 meters (50 feet) without being injured. Their small size and low body weight mean they reach a low terminal velocity, so they can survive falls from heights that would be deadly to larger animals.",
  "Male rats typically have very large testicles relative to their body. In fact, a male rat’s testes can account for up to 1% of its body mass. This is due to sperm competition—males evolved to produce a lot of sperm when females may mate with multiple males.",
  "The Himalayan field rat (Rattus nitidus), sometimes called the white-footed rat, is common in parts of South and Southeast Asia and often lives at high elevations—unlike the lowland-dwelling brown rat, this species has been found in the Himalayas at elevations over 3,000 meters.",
  "In language, rats feature in several idioms. For example, \"to rat on\" someone means to betray them, and \"like a drowned rat\" describes a person who is soaking wet and disheveled.",
  "In plague times, some cities tried to pay bounties for dead rats. In Hanoi in 1902, a bounty on rats led to a scheme where some people bred rats or just cut off their tails (to show as proof for reward) and let the rats go, which backfired. It’s a classic example of a \"perverse incentive\" in pest control.",
  "Some species of rats (like the Sumatran bamboo rat) are almost solitary and very slow-moving, whereas others (like the brown rat) are highly social and quick. \"Rat\" is a broad term that covers a lot of behavioral diversity depending on the species.",
  "The average wild brown rat weighs around 200–300 grams (7–10 oz). City rats that have ample food can get larger (half a kilogram or more). Stories of rats as big as cats are usually exaggerations or refer to different rodents like muskrats or young nutria.",
  "Some rats in coastal mangrove areas have been observed to catch small fish or crustaceans. These \"fishing rats\" will wade into shallow water and use their quick reflexes to grab aquatic prey—showing that not all wild rats rely solely on scavenging and vegetation.",
  "Rats occasionally perform a \"belly-up\" or submissive posture when confronting a dominant rat: the subordinate rat will roll on its back to signal defeat and avoid further aggression.",
  "Rats can be trained to do several tricks and will also learn their name. Pet rats have been taught to fetch small objects, run agility courses, and even jump through hoops on command using positive reinforcement training.",
  "Brown rats have been observed killing and eating smaller rodents such as mice. In laboratory settings, male rats will sometimes instinctively attack and kill mice (a behavior dubbed \"muricide\").",
  "In captivity, rats can recognize their owner’s voice and scent. Many pet rats will come when called by name and will brux (grind their teeth softly) when petted by someone they trust, which is a sign of contentment.",
  "Black rats (also called roof rats) are more agile climbers than brown rats. They often live in attics, trees, and upper parts of buildings, whereas brown rats prefer to burrow underground or stay at ground level.",
  "Rats are extremely social and affectionate animals. They enjoy the company of other rats and can even form strong bonds with human caregivers. Pet rats often like to cuddle, and some will happily sit on a shoulder or in a lap for gentle petting.",
  "Unlike many small mammals, rats do not hibernate. They remain active year-round. In colder climates, rats simply seek warmer shelter during winter (often moving closer to heated buildings or underground) and continue scavenging for food as usual.",
  "Experiments have shown that rats possess a form of metacognition. In one study, rats could choose to decline a difficult memory test (opting out when unsure). This suggests they have some awareness of what they remember or don’t remember—an ability previously demonstrated clearly only in primates.",
  "The term “rodent” comes from the Latin \"rodere\" meaning \"to gnaw.\" Rats gnaw not only to access food or create openings but also to wear down their incisors. A rat that cannot gnaw (if its teeth were misaligned or broken) would soon have overgrown teeth and starve.",
  "According to Chinese legend, the reason the rat is first in the zodiac is that it outsmarted the other animals. In the great race called by the Jade Emperor, the clever rat hitched a ride on the ox’s back and then jumped off at the finish line, beating the ox and everyone else.",
  "In captivity, rats display a behavior called \"popcorning\" – hopping excitedly – usually when they’re happy or anticipating food or play. (This term is borrowed from guinea pig owners, but rats can do it too when they’re especially excited.)",
  "Rats can swim about half a mile in open water and can tread water for up to three days. They have been known to cross bodies of water to colonize new areas; for example, swimming between riverbanks or across small canals is well within a rat’s abilities.",
  "Most wild rats survive only about a year. In contrast, pet rats, protected from predators and disease, routinely live 2 to 3 years. The oldest pet rats on record have lived just over 4 years, which is exceptionally old for a rat.",
  "Rats sleep in cycles throughout the day, typically being most active at dusk and dawn. When they sleep, they can enter REM sleep (the dreaming stage). Studies of brainwaves have shown that rats in REM sleep sometimes have patterns suggesting they are \"replaying\" experiences (like running a maze) in their dreams.",
  "Among rodents, rats are particularly notable for their intelligence. In maze tests and problem-solving tasks, rats often perform better than mice—they can remember solutions to mazes for weeks and apply learned strategies to new problems.",
  "Desert-dwelling rat species (like certain kangaroo rats or gerbil-like rats) can survive with very little water. They conserve water efficiently and get moisture from the seeds and plants they eat, often living without ever drinking free-standing water.",
  "Rats communicate with each other via pheromones. For example, a frightened rat releases an odor that can warn others of danger. Mother rats also use pheromones to signal to their pups or to induce puberty delay in daughters if the population is large and resources are scarce.",
  "The Madagascar giant jumping rat (Hypogeomys antimena) is a rodent native to Madagascar that looks like an overgrown rat but hops like a rabbit. It’s monogamous (pairs for life) and critically endangered. It’s not a true \"Rattus\" rat, but this example shows the diversity of rat-like rodents.",
  "Brown rats (Norway rats) are omnivores that will eat almost anything available—from grains and fruits to insects, meat, and garbage. Black rats (roof rats) tend to favor plant material like fruits, nuts, and seeds, and are more likely to be found in trees or high places.",
  "A rat’s heart beats extremely fast (around 6 to 7 beats per second). If you hold a calm pet rat, its rapid heartbeat feels like a constant vibration.",
  "Rats are one of the most widespread mammals on Earth, found on every continent except Antarctica. Wherever humans go and leave waste behind, rats often follow—on ships, planes, and trucks—making them a truly global species.",
  "Reproductive suppression can occur in rat colonies: if the colony is at carrying capacity, pheromones from dominant animals might delay sexual maturity in subordinate juveniles. This is a natural mechanism to prevent overcrowding and resource exhaustion in the colony.",
  "Albino rats (white fur and pink eyes) were among the first rats domesticated for scientific research. These \"lab white\" rats were easy to breed and handle, and they became the ancestors of many pet rats today.",
  "Black rats (Rattus rattus) typically have a tail longer than their head-and-body length, whereas brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) have a tail a bit shorter than their body. This is one quick way to tell the species apart on sight.",
  "Rats in urban environments often have exposure to toxic substances. City rats have been found with traces of lead, pesticides, and other chemicals in their bodies (picked up from trash and contaminated environments), yet they often appear healthy—indicating a robust tolerance for pollutants that would harm other animals.",
  "Rats have dichromatic vision. They have two types of color receptors in their eyes (sensitive to blues and greens) but no receptors for red light. This means they see the world mostly in shades of blue and green and cannot distinguish red hues.",
  "Male rats do not have nipples, whereas female rats typically have 12 nipples (six pairs). This is a quick way to tell a male from a female—only females have visible nipples on their belly.",
  "Each of a rat’s eyes can move independently, allowing rats to see a broad field—including partially above them—without moving their head. This, along with their whiskers, helps them detect predators from multiple angles.",
  "Rats will sometimes grind their teeth when stressed or in pain, but this behavior typically expresses contentment and relaxation when done softly. The soft grinding, called bruxing, often comes with the rat’s eyes boggling (bulging rhythmically) and is a sign of a very content rat.",
  "Rats constantly leave dribbles of urine as they explore (a behavior called \"urine marking\"). These scent marks help them map their environment and communicate with other rats about where they’ve been, who’s territory it is, and sexual readiness.",
  "The skin on a rat’s tail is very tough, but it can be damaged. If a rat’s tail is grabbed roughly, the outer skin and scales can strip off (degloving injury). This is extremely painful and dangerous for the rat. Therefore, one should never pick up a rat by its tail.",
  "Rats show social learning: if one rat encounters a novel food and survives eating it, other rats will be more likely to try that food after smelling it on the first rat’s breath. This is called \"social transmission\" of diet preferences.",
  "When two male rats vie for dominance, they often engage in a ritualized sparring. They might sidle up and push against each other or stand and \"box.\" These bouts usually end when one rat submits and rarely cause serious injury in a stable group.",
  "Newborn rat pups are born hairless, blind, and deaf. They develop a fine coat of fur by one week old, their ears unfold around day 3–5, and their eyes open between 12 and 17 days old. By three weeks, they are weaned and can eat solid food.",
  "Many cities attempt novel rat control measures beyond poison. For example, some have tested contraceptive bait (to reduce rat fertility), sonic deterrents, dry ice burrow treatments, and even training teams of terriers to hunt rats in alleyways at night.",
  "A single pair of rats and their offspring can theoretically produce thousands of rats in just one year if unchecked, but in reality many of the young don’t survive that long due to competition, predation, and other natural limits.",
  "Rats in captivity can be litter-trained to use a small litter box, as they often choose one or a few spots as \"bathrooms\". Their trainability makes them surprisingly tidy pets.",
  "APOPO, an organization in Tanzania, trains African giant pouched rats to sniff out landmines and tuberculosis. These \"HeroRATs\" have cleared thousands of mines and can screen lab samples for TB far faster than a human technician.",
  "Rats sometimes \"laugh\" during play even if not being tickled directly. When young rats chase and play-wrestle, they emit brief ultrasonic chirps associated with positive emotion. So playtime with peers is filled with laughter in frequencies we can’t hear.",
  "Wild rats sometimes practice \"commensal\" behaviors with other species. For example, rats may follow bats into caves and feed on insects stirred up by the bats or on guano. In cities, rats often rely on human garbage (thus commensal with humans). Their ability to capitalize on the activities of others is a key survival trait.",
  "Rats can hear sounds up to about 90–100 kHz (kilohertz), far above the range of human hearing (which tops out around 20 kHz). Their ultrasonic hearing is used for communication (such as mating calls or squeals that are inaudible to predators like us).",
  "During historical plague pandemics, a die-off of rats often preceded human outbreaks. People would see dead rats in the streets—an ominous sign that infected fleas were about to move to human hosts and cause illness.",
  "The story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin (who supposedly lured rats, and then children, away) may be allegorical, but it echoes a real historical fear. In the Middle Ages, towns did hire rat-catchers, and someone exceptionally skilled could seem almost magical. The story also underscores the importance of fulfilling one’s promises (as the town didn’t pay the piper, so he took the children as revenge in the legend).",
  "A domesticated rat named Magawa was awarded a gold medal by the British charity PDSA in 2020 for his life-saving work detecting landmines in Cambodia. He was the first rat to receive this honor, highlighting the value of rats’ keen sense of smell and trainability.",
  "Rats are capable of playing hide-and-seek. In one experiment, rats were taught to play with human researchers—they would reliably find a hidden person, or go hide and wait to be found. The rats not only learned the game, but they often \"laughed\" (ultrasonically) and jumped for joy during play, indicating they found it fun.",
  "In the Chinese zodiac, the rat is the first of the twelve animals and symbolizes intelligence, adaptability, and prosperity.",
  "Rats cannot burp or vomit due to a strong muscular ridge in their stomach and a weak diaphragm reflex. This inability to vomit is why rats are very cautious eaters—they nibble and wait to see if they get sick. It’s also one reason poison is effective against them, because they can’t regurgitate it.",
  "When Pixar created the 2007 film Ratatouille, the animators kept pet rats in their offices to study their movements and behavior for accuracy. They noted details like how rats’ noses wiggle and their ears twitch when sniffing, incorporating those into the animation to make the character Remy more realistic.",
  "The Florida Panthers of the NHL have a tradition called the \"rat-trick\" where fans throw plastic rats on the ice during the playoffs. This started in 1996 after a player killed a locker room rat and then scored a hat-trick; now it’s a celebrated bit of team folklore.",
  "Rats have a very keen sense of smell—much better than humans. They use smell to recognize other rats, find food, and detect danger. Rats have even been trained to use their sense of smell to detect landmines and diagnose diseases (like sniffing out tuberculosis in lab samples).",
  "A healthy rat’s teeth are yellow-orange. If you see a rat with bright white teeth, it’s likely a very young animal or one with a dental issue. The coloration comes from iron pigments and indicates strong enamel.",
  "Rats learn what foods are safe from other rats. If a rat smells a specific food on another rat’s breath and that rat is healthy, it will be more inclined to eat that food. Conversely, if it smells a food and the rat who ate it is sick or dead, it will avoid that food. This social transmission of diet preferences helps rats survive in hazardous environments.",
  "A rat’s brain, though only about the size of a lima bean, has a sophisticated structure similar to a human’s brain, which supports their complex emotions and learning abilities.",
  "Historically, rats have been blamed for great plagues, but they have also saved lives. In modern times, \"HeroRATs\" trained in Africa have screened thousands of tuberculosis samples more quickly than human lab techs, helping to identify TB patients who might have been missed.",
  "If one rat in a colony encounters a poisonous bait and becomes ill, other rats may learn to avoid that food. Rats are capable of \"bait shyness\"—associating a certain taste or food with sickness—making future control attempts with the same poison less effective once a few rats have sampled it and survived.",
  "Rats have been to space! The Soviet Union and the US both sent rats on early space missions (after fruit flies and mice, but before larger animals) to test the effects of microgravity on mammals. These \"astro-rats\" helped pave the way for later animal and human spaceflight.",
  "Rats are a generalist species and can thrive in a multitude of environmental conditions by adapting their diet and behavior to what’s available. They’re equally at home in a barn, a sewer, a forest, or a subway tunnel, as long as they have food, water, and shelter.",
  "The so-called \"super rats\" in media are often just regular brown rats that have grown large from abundant food and have genetic resistance to poison. There is no separate species of \"super rat,\" but continuous selective pressure (like poisoning) can make surviving rats tougher and larger on average.",
  "In cognitive experiments, rats have shown behaviors suggesting regret. In one study, after making a poor decision (skipping a favored food and then finding the alternative was worse), rats exhibited dejected behaviors and sometimes looked back at the \"missed\" option—scientists interpreted this as a rat analog of regret.",
  "Juvenile rats are extremely playful. By three weeks of age, young rats start play-fighting: they pounce, pin, and wrestle with littermates. This roughhousing is crucial for normal social development and helps establish the hierarchy when they mature.",
  "Folklore around the world often casts rats as omens. In some European traditions, if rats suddenly abandoned a ship or house, it was seen as a sign of impending disaster, reflecting the idea that rats \"sense\" trouble (this is the origin of \"rats fleeing a sinking ship\").",
  "Contrary to a common myth, rats (and other rodents) do not actually grow endlessly large in size. Their growth does slow after maturity. \"Giant rats\" in legends are usually either another species or individual rats in exceptionally good conditions.",
  "In the wild, rats face about 95% mortality in their first year of life. Predators, disease, and food scarcity mean that relatively few rats live to old age (which for a wild rat might be 1–2 years). In contrast, a well-cared-for pet rat often lives 2–3 years.",
  "Capable of squeezing into remarkably small spaces, a brown rat can fit through an opening about 20 mm (under an inch) across—roughly the size of a U.S. quarter—by flattening its flexible body and skull.",
  "Rats use their whiskers in the dark to determine an object's size, shape, orientation, and texture — a behavior known as \"whisking.\"",
  "In laboratories, rats have even been used to study driving. Scientists built tiny rat-sized cars and found that rats could learn to drive them to reach a reward. Interestingly, the act of learning to drive seemed to reduce the rats’ stress hormone levels, suggesting enrichment activities are beneficial for them.",
  "The fastest a rat can run is only about 10 km/h (6 mph), but they are adept at quick dashes and can change direction very rapidly. Their agility in tight spaces is more impressive than outright speed—they can zigzag through cluttered environments much faster than a larger animal could.",
  "Rats can climb astounding heights and vertical surfaces. They have been observed climbing brick or concrete walls by wedging into small cracks and using their claws. They can also scamper along power lines or ropes with great balance, aided by their tail.",
  "The Gambian pouched rat (Cricetomys gambianus), native to Africa, can grow up to 90 cm (3 feet) long including the tail and weigh 1.5–1.8 kg (3–4 lbs). One urban legend claimed some reached 9 lbs, but 3–4 lbs is typical. These giant rats have been introduced invasively to places like Florida and are the ones trained as \"HeroRATs\" for mine detection.",
  "The Black Death (bubonic plague) in the 14th century killed an estimated 30–60% of Europe’s population. While rats (and their fleas) were primary vectors, interestingly, plague still exists today in wild rodent populations (like ground squirrels in the western US), but modern hygiene and antibiotics prevent major outbreaks.",
  "Rats have a higher average body temperature (~38 °C or 100 °F) than humans. Their high metabolism also means they heal relatively quickly from minor injuries, but they can become dehydrated faster than larger animals if they don’t have water, due to moisture lost through rapid breathing and urine.",
  "The U.S. reports roughly 14,000 direct attacks or bites by rats on people each year. While rat bites are less common than dog or cat bites, they can lead to infections like rat-bite fever if not properly cleaned and treated.",
  "Rats display an interesting behavior called \"food neophobia\": they are suspicious of new foods. Wild rats might nibble a tiny bit of a novel food and wait. If they feel unwell later, they will avoid that food thereafter. This makes poisoning challenging, as rats may sample a sub-lethal dose and then learn to shun the bait.",
  "The largest rat organ (proportionally) is the liver. Rats have a very large liver relative to their body, which helps them detoxify many substances. This is one reason they can survive low doses of poisons and why they’re often used in toxicology studies.",
